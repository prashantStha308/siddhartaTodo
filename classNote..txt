    Installing Capacitor
    Adding Android plugin

Github:
    git add
    git commit -m ""
    git push

    Github Actions:
        create .github folder
        create .github/workflows/build-android.yaml

        DON"T EXPLAIN .yaml (too complex for them... would be better to avoid this at all, but not possible)
        Get .apk in Github Action Artifacts
